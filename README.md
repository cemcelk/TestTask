## iOS App Details
- Base project "https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/ios"
- Using TensorFlow object detection and AVFoundation Camera APIs, recognize any of the objects supported by TensorFlow open-source object detection models. Once the object is recognized with above 50% certainty, a simple alert should display the object name.
- On a first frame that recognizes object detection above 70% certainty, pause the camera, extract that frame, apply the following transformations to the frame:
   Rotate the frame by 90Â° clockwise
- With in that same frame, change all the colors from yellow colors range to equivalent purple
   colors in the purple color range. (i.e. yellow color (RGB(255,255,0)) should be swapped with RGB(128,0,128) and all the other unique yellow hex colors should have a unique pair in purple color range.) After these transformations are applied, the final result of frame manipulation should be displayed in an overlay image view.
